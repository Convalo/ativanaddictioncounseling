              <h2><strong>ATIVAN ADDICTION COUNSELING: NOT A DELICATE SUBJECT</strong></h2>
              <p>Counseling a substance abuser with the hope of steering him or her away from their drug of choice, is not an easy task.</p>
              <p>With addiction, a counselor goes beyond the drug to the root of a person&rsquo;s issues, which more often than not examines the psychological and physical aspects that are the basis of a person&rsquo;s ailment.</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/the-anxiety-of-ativan">Ativan</a> is a particularly tough drug to counsel a person away from because of its medicinal uses and intents.</p>
              <p>In other words, a legitimate user of Ativan probably has been taking the drug for practical reasons of steering themselves from chronic disorders that can effect that person&rsquo;s daily life.</p>
              <p>To put it another way, there is a good chance that seasoned users of Ativan who have had to rely on the drug to more-or-less function in anxious environments, are addicted to the medication.</p>
              <p>At this point, the Ativan <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/">addiction counselor</a> finds him or herself fighting two fronts; one is the patient&rsquo;s addiction to Ativan, while the second front is the person&rsquo;s anxiety, and once they have kicked their Ativan addiction, how will they be reintroduced to the world which required they take the drug in the first place?</p>
              <p>It&rsquo;s a tough position to be in, let alone lead someone away from.              </p>
              <h2><strong>IMPLICATIONS ON TOP OF IMPLICATIONS</strong></h2>
              <p>What is both interesting and extremely challenging about Ativan addiction counseling, as well as counseling with other drug types designed to help patients with pain or stress, is that in many instances, a counselor is competing with two addictions. </p>
              <p>Implications can increase exponentially if a patient is mixing one drug with another, such as alcohol, to enhance the high their addiction provides.</p>
              <p>This can result in much more difficult and much longer sessions for the patient and counselor. Consequently, the patient&rsquo;s stay can extend itself far past what was initially expected, throwing off the recovery time, and in the end, depressing the patient even more.</p>
              <h2><strong>MORE TO BE EXPECTED</strong></h2>
              <p>Substances such as Ativan, as well as many other prescription drugs, have increasingly become only part of a person&rsquo;s addiction. It&rsquo;s more common now to find a patient who is addicted to more than just one substance due to a variety of circumstances. Three of the most common are:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Long-term use, which as a patient learns to rely on their prescribed drug as a psycho-emotional crutch, they invariably become psychologically and physically addicted.              </li>
                <li>The use and eventual abuse of another drug, such as alcohol, or another opioid to intensify the high they initially received via their prescribed drug.</li>
                <li>Someone who has been using the drug illegally, has now become addicted, but blames social, psychological and even physical issues for their addiction. Thus, they&rsquo;re nonfunctional in through their daily life.              </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Yes, drug counseling is tough. It takes a combination of compassion and strength to help a person get past their ailment.</p>
              <p>What makes this job even more challenging are the new and more powerful drugs that seem to endlessly come off the streets and onto our pharmaceutical market.</p>
              <p>There also is the continually new and innovative mixtures of these prescription drugs with other drugs, pairing them up for a high that has yet to be realized.</p>
              <p>Inevitably, this could mean much more work for the drug counselors as well as potentially longer stays in rehab. </p>
              <p>It&rsquo;s the nature of addiction. No one said it was easy, including your counselor. Of course, having so many cases that vary so highly, they probably know about that by now.</p>
